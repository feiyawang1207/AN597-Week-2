#Homework 1 
#Module 4
#Challenge 1.1
```{r}

x<-"Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed."
#make the first line as a string variable

x1<-gsub("[[:punct:]]","",x)
#take the punction out of the string

x2<-stringr::str_split(x1," ",simplify = FALSE)
#seperate the string by space to get the word

v<-unlist(x2)
#x2 is a list now, make x2 into a vector use unlist()
v
#first question finish
```

n<-length(v)
#know the last index of the v

v[seq(from = 1, to = n, by = 3)]
#take every third element from the vector

#example matrix

x<-c(m[,2],m[,3],m[,6])
#extract 2nd, 3rd,6th column
x
#show x

```
#Challenge 2.2
```{r}
m <- matrix(data=1:80,nrow=8,ncol=10,byrow=FALSE)
#example matrix

x<-c(m[6,],m[8,])

#Challage 5

```{r}
 m <- matrix(c(3, 0, 1 ,23, 1, 2, 33, 1, 1, 42, 0, 1, 41, 0, 2),nrow=5,ncol=3,byrow=FALSE)
#create matrix

df<-as.data.frame(m)
#convert to data frame

df[,2]=as.logical(df[,2])
#change the colume 2 into logical value

#five Challenge I meet when i do the coding.
1. it take me 1hour to get familliar with the R language's function and how to run teh code.
2. for the first challenge question, I feel unclear about how to split the sentence as well as use function from package that we install.

Since I have coding experience with other languages like python. I know about the algorithm and logic. I also get familir with how to write the annotation after step. So i feel the first week is not really challenge for me in other parts.  

I do learn from my peer Commentary group. I understand the code better when i get to review all the function with my group.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
